Inside this folder, create a .txt file inside that folder named `<first>-<last>.txt`.

The file should contain a sentence on your Git/Github or other version control experience along with any questions you have.

##### Example
###### git-and-github/participants/bernease-herman.txt

I've used Git as an individual, but haven't used remote repositories or collaborative features like pull requests.

I'd like to know how I can lookup the people who've changed a particular file in my repo.
